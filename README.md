# IGN_CODE_FOO_2016

1.)Take a short video (no more than 5 minutes) introducing yourself, showing your passion 
for IGN, and telling us why we should pick you to participate in IGN's Code-Foo program. 
Upload it to YouTube and send us the link.

2.)To find out how many Legos are needed we first need to find the area of the bridge so 
we know that the length of the bridge is 8,981ft which when converted to mm is 2,737,409mm
The width of bridge 90 feet which again when converted is 27,432mm.  So we take those 
dimensions and we get the area ( L * W = A) of 808,290ft or 75.092,603,688mm. Now we need the
dimensions of a standard 2X4 brick, The width would be 15.8mm the length is 31.8mm and height 
would be 9.6. This would get you an area of 502.44 mm^2

So now we can find how many logos it would take to fill the bridge we take the area of the 
brick and divide that into the bridge and it gets you 149,455,862.77(rounded to the nearest 
hundredth)Legos. 

so now we can figure out how many legos tall it would be by finding out how high the bridge is. 
At the highest point the bridge has towers that reach 746feet the height of just the bridge is 
246feet which is 74,980.8mm.

Now we take 74,980.8 / 9.6 and this gives us 7,810.5 Legos. so now we can take our data and 
find out that a rough estimate of 149,487,104.77. rounded to the nearest hundredth
